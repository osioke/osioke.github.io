# Contributing to Atom

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to 
[my personal website](https://sprimed.com).

I am still working around what this guide will be, but for now, if you want to 
contribute, just head over to the 
[issues page](https://github.com/osioke/sprimed.com/issues) and start an issue 
discussing what you want to add. Thanks :simple_smile: :+1:.
